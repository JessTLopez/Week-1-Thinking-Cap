## Summary

The article by Tony Barboza is on the asphalt dominated, Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) campuses that are common in low-income communities of color. LAUSD schools in communities of color have insufficient tree canopy coverage, lack greenspaces for children to play in, and are found in communities which are already vulnerable to high heat exposure and "suffer from a lack of tree canopy and park space." LAUSD is one of the largest landowners in the city of Los Angeles, whose asphalt dominated properties contribute to the heat island effect. This article argues that asphalt dominated schoolyards are an environmental injustice because such communities "are a product of decades of discriminatory policies, environmental racism, and historical redlining," and have long been excluded from investment in parks and open spaces. The new LAUSD superintendent Alberto Carvalho along with advocates, like [The Los Angeles Living School Yards Coalition](https://www.lalivingschoolyards.org/) are advocating to integrate park and green spaces in school sites that will benefit students during school hours, and benefit the community during school after hours, offering green spaces for communities who lack green/open spaces. Advocates are pushing to green up schools before the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics. As a parent of an LAUSD student this article was relevant to me because the issues addressed by students and teachers in the article are the same issues my daughter encounters daily. Some issues raised, for example, included not having a shaded area to play in. This too is an issue for my dauther, particularly during summer when the heat is more intense. Not having shade or the right to shelter because the shaded areas are restricted or too far from the commmon play areas leads to lack of exercise and many related health conditions for LAUSD students, as it does for my daughter. As a future planner and current resident and parent of the LAUSD, I understand why it is critical to provide all communities, policymakers, and stakeholders with adequate data and maps in order to make informed decisions. Good spatial data and maps are critical pieces needed to advocate for change, particularly for communities who have to fight for funding. 

## Graphical Outputs

This article features the images of two maps. One map displays the "Current Park Needs" in Los Angeles and the other map, "After Incorporating All Schoolyards," displays the need for parks after the integration of green spaces/parks in Los Angeles schoolyards. The maps utilized for this article are powered by Esri. The article lists [The Trust for Public Land](https://www.tpl.org/) website for additional map information. The Esri maps and additional layers were published by The Trust for Public Land and use the [ParkServe](https://parkserve.tpl.org/mapping/index.html?CityID=0644000) platform to track and map urban park access throughout the United States. While this article was relevant for me and my particular interests, the maps did not leave an impression of urgency to solve the environmental injustices that have long plagued LAUSD campuses in communities of color. Rather than providing an image, it would have been more useful to have an interactive map, like the one featured on [The ParkServe](https://parkserve.tpl.org/mapping/index.html?CityID=0644000) website where readers can engage and interact with the maps and layers.
